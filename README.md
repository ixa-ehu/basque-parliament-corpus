# BasqueParl: A Bilingual Corpus of Basque Parliamentary Transcriptions

This repository contains **BasqueParl**, a bilingual corpus for political discourse analysis. It covers transcriptions from the Parliament of the Basque Autonomous Community for eight years and two legislative terms (2012-2020), and its main characteristic is the presence of Basque-Spanish code-switching speeches.

The specificities of the **BasqueParl** corpus are:

- **14 M words** of bilingual parliamentary transcriptions
- **Speech paragraphs** as units
- Metadata such as **date** and **speaker's name**, **gender** and **party** for each paragraph, as well as the **political position** if any
- **Language** of each paragraph (either Basque or Spanish)
- **Lemmas** and **named entities** of each paragraph, with and without stopwords
